# js-testing-introduction

`This is a repo where trying to study and understand the what, why and how of Test Driven Development.`

I am testing the behaviour of the application and my understanding of how the three stages of testing works by implemention of javascript testing - unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing.

I made use of jest.js framework testing environment to mock and simulate the whole process and also made use of google's puppeteer which runs on chromium to check the end-to-end behaviour and validation to see that they're all in sync and are not broken.

Thanks to Academind whose youtube video tutorials i meticulously followed to implement this testing successfully in javascript which has helped me to gain an a basic knowledge of the Test Driven development.
